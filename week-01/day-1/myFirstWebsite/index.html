        <p>I have had a very good relationship with computers since my youth,
            but now after many, many years, I just realize that I want to pursue this field professionally 
            and totally direct my career to programming.<br>
            <br>
            Well, life is change and I like changes. It`s nothing worse than riding a dead horse. :-)
