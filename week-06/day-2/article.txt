Ridley Hall is a theological college located in Sidgwick Avenue in Cambridge in the United Kingdom, which trains men and women intending to take Holy Orders, as deacon or priest of the Church of England, and members of the laity working with children and young people, as lay pioneers and within a pastoral capacity such as lay chaplaincy. It was founded in 1881 and named in memory of Nicholas Ridley, a leading Anglican theologian and martyr of the sixteenth century. The college's first principal was the theologian Handley Moule, later Bishop of Durham.[2]

Although not formally a constituent college of the University of Cambridge, Ridley Hall maintains close ties with the university, and some of its students are awarded qualifications by the university's Faculty of Divinity. Until the introduction of the Common Award, degrees were also awarded to students by Anglia Ruskin University. Along with all other training institutions, Ridley Hall now offers several Common Award qualifications, accredited by Durham University. (The colleges of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge are still able to also offer degrees of their own university, but institutions in other locations may only offer the common award). Ridley Hall's teaching tends towards an evangelical theology, and it is one of four Church of England theological colleges, the others being St John's College, Nottingham, Trinity College, Bristol, and Cranmer Hall, Durham, which self-identify as "Open Evangelical".[3][4] The current principal of Ridley Hall is Michael Volland, who succeeded Andrew Norman, who moved on to become Director of Ministry and Mission in the Diocese of Leeds.

Ridley Hall forms part of the Cambridge Theological Federation, along with Westcott House, Westminster College, the Institute for Orthodox Christian Studies, and others.

It publishes an academic journal, Anvil.
